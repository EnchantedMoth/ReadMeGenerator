## README Generator

## My Task

This was challenge #9 of coding bootcamp. The challenge was to develop existing code so it can write a readme file after prompting the user for questions.

You can quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one.

## Installation
In your integrated terminal make sure you are in the right folder.

First make sure to have all the dependencies downloaded. Use this command:

```bash
npm i
```


Then run the application by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```
Then answer the questions as prompted and a README file will be generated for you.
